I generally do things like this without.  Glad I went with Kiwi.  He arranged the tuk tuk ride, and guided me to the point where the trail has no more splits.  From there he instructed me on how to get to the summit, we took a picture together and he was on his way.  Then I was hiking up this beautiful volcano happily by myself at my own pace.\nEntry fee to park is 100Q, tuk tuk was 15Q each way, and I gave Kiwi 50Q.  All of this for 180Q.\nLeave early.  It gets hot!  I got into tuk tuk at 7 am (we met at dock), took about 3.5 hours hiking up to the summit, spent a good hour there, and about 1.5 hours to get back down.\nBe warned.
