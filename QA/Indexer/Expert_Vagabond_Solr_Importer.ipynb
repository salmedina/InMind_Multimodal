As I haven’t really got a clue of where to go and what to see, in order to capture some beautiful and amazing photos. Now after reading your post, I have decided on at least 5 places I should go and see.\n",

I stayed a week and the whole time most of Iceland was a blanket of white snow. It was magical and celebrating Christmas in the unique Iceland tradition was amazing. The magical experience of witnessing the Northern Lights was the highlight. however, I know I must go back in the summer, spring or fall to see the whimsical colors that make the name Iceland a complete misnomer. Last month I was in Norway, saying the same: must come in summer for the fjords. I don’t know why I always end up in Scandinavia and Nordic countries in Winter. No more!\n",

I wasn’t sure if I even needed a guide.  I generally do things like this without.  Glad I went with Kiwi.  He arranged the tuk tuk ride, and guided me to the point where the trail has no more splits.  From there he instructed me on how to get to the summit, we took a picture together and he was on his way.  Then I was hiking up this beautiful volcano happily by myself at my own pace.\n",
